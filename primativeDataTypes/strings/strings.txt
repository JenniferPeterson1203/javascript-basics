What is a string?

In javascript, a string is a sequence of of characters used to represent text. Strings are 
immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation. Strings can be enclosed in:

- Single quotes (' ')
- Double Quotes (" ")
- Template Literals (``)

String Methods and Properties:

Understanding the differnce between methods and properties:

Everything in javascript are objects. This will be expanded upon in later lessons. All objects 
have various properties and methods. So what is the difference between properties and methods?
Properties are essentially key value parts within an object. They store data of state about the
object. Methods are functions attached to the object.

Properties on the String object:

.length

Methods on the String object:
.slice()
.splice()
.split()
.toUpperCase()
.toLowerCase()
.concat()
.charAt()
.index()
