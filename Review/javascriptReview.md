**B.** A programming language known for its use in web development and executed in the browser  
**C.** A database query language used to manage relational databases  
**D.** A low-level programming language used to develop operating systems  

## 2. Why was ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) an important update to JavaScript?

**A.** It replaced JavaScript with a completely new programming language  
**B.** It deprecated JavaScript in favor of TypeScript  
**C.** It introduced significant improvements like `let` and `const`, arrow functions, and template literals

**B.** `let`  
**C.** `const`  
**D.** All of the above  

## 4. Which data type is NOT primitive in JavaScript?

**A.** `null`  
**B.** `undefined`  
**C.** `object`  
**D.** `number`  

## 5. What will `typeof null` return?

**A.** `null`  
**B.** `undefined`  
**C.** `object`  
**D.** `number`  

## 6. Which of the following is NOT a valid way to declare a function?

**A.** `function myFunc() {};`  
**B.** `const myFunc = function() {};`  
**C.** `const myFunc = () => {};`  
**D.** `const myFunc = new Function();`  

## 7. What is the default return value of a JavaScript function if no `return` statement is provided?

**A.** `null`  
**B.** `0`  
**C.** `false`  
**D.** `undefined`  

## 8. What will the following code output?

```javascript
let x = [10, 20, 30];
let y = [...x, 40];
console.log(y);
```

**A.** `[10, 20, 30, 40]`  
**B.** `[10, 20, 30]`  
**C.** `[40, 10, 20, 30]`  
**D.** `Error`  

## 9. Is JavaScript a dynamically typed or statically typed language?

**A.** Dynamically typed  
**B.** Statically typed  
**C.** Both dynamically and statically typed  
**D.** Neither  

## 10. What is the key difference between dynamically typed and statically typed languages?

**A.** Dynamically typed languages require variables to have explicit types  
**B.** Statically typed languages perform type checking at runtime  
**C.** Dynamically typed languages check types at runtime, while statically typed languages check them at compile time  
**D.** Statically typed languages allow implicit type conversion, while dynamically typed languages do not  

## 11. Which of the following is an example of a statically typed language?

**A.** JavaScript  
**B.** Python  
**C.** Ruby  
**D.** TypeScript  

## 12. Which of these is NOT a characteristic of dynamically typed languages?

**A.** Type checking happens at runtime  
**B.** Variables do not require explicit type declarations  
**C.** They prevent all runtime type errors  
**D.** They allow implicit type coercion  

## 13. Which of the following is true about statically typed languages?

**A.** They perform type checking at runtime  
**B.** They prevent type errors at compile time  
**C.** They do not require explicit type declarations  
**D.** They allow variables to change types dynamically  

## 14. What will be the output of the following JavaScript code?

```javascript
let x = "5" + 2;
console.log(x);
```

**A.** `7`  
**B.** `"52"`  
**C.** `Error: Type mismatch`  
**D.** `52`  

## 15. Which of the following best describes implicit type coercion?

**A.** The programmer manually converts a value from one type to another  
**B.** The programming language automatically converts a value from one type to another  
**C.** The compiler throws an error if types do not match  
**D.** A variable’s type remains unchanged throughout its lifecycle  

## 16. Which of these expressions demonstrates implicit type coercion in JavaScript?

**A.** `let num = Number("42");`  
**B.** `console.log("5" * 2);`  
**C.** `let str = String(100);`  
**D.** `let x: number = 10;`  

## 17. Which of these is an example of explicit type coercion?

**A.** `console.log("5" - 3);`  
**B.** `console.log("10" + 2);`  
**C.** `console.log(Number("100") + 20);`  
**D.** `console.log(5 == "5");`  

## 18. Why do statically typed languages typically have better performance than dynamically typed languages?

**A.** They use an interpreter instead of a compiler  
**B.** They allow variables to change types freely  
**C.** Types are known at compile time, allowing optimizations  
**D.** They rely on runtime type checking  

## 19. What would be the result of the following TypeScript code?

```typescript
let nums: number = 42;
let str: string = '10';
console.log(nums + str);
```

**A.** `52`  
**B.** `"4210"`  
**C.** `Error: Type mismatch`  
**D.** `4210`  


## 20. What would be the result of the following TypeScript code?

```typescript
let nums: number = 42;
let str: string = '10';
console.log(nums + str);
```

**A.** `52`  
**B.** `"4210"`  
**C.** `Error: Type mismatch`  
**D.** `4210`  

## 21. Why are you able to use the split function on a string but not a number? (short answer)

## 22. Why does console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); return false?

## 23. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

## 24. Why does console.log(5 == "5"); return true but console.log(5 === "5"); return false?
